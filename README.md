This is the second assignment for the Research Track 1 exam for the Robotics Engineering Master's degree at the University of Genoa.

## Simulator
The assignemnt takes place in Gazebo, a 3D ROS simulator. The Rviz tool is also used to provide a model of the simulator robot, including sensors, to help the user debug the robot application.

To run the environment, namely, the windows mentioned above Gazebo and Rviz, complete the following procedure (If you do not have already installed ROS on your computer, you can download and install the Noetic version used in this assignment at https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation).
Steps:
* open at least two terminals.
* in the first one, move into your ROS workspace and run the master with the command `roscore`.
